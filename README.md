**Technologies Used**

Developed this website using Frontend technologies  such as ReactJS, Redux, and SCSS. I crafted a fully responsive website linked with an API. Leveraging core React concepts like JSX, components, props, state, and lifecycle, along with advanced techniques like conditional rendering, lists, and keys. With Redux, I've implemented complex JavaScript logics for an interactive and aesthetically pleasing React application.
